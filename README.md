# Flight-planner

#This project 
#Built a Flight-Planner program that provided viable flight paths given a start and a destination to understand graph algorithms

#Utilized Java to program a Depth-First Search algorithm implementation to form flight paths and return the top three paths in terms of either time or flight cost
